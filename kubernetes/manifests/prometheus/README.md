# Summary

Monitor any host using Prometheus for metrics, Alert manager for alerts, Cadvisor for container data, and Node Exporter for host data.

I experiemented with deploying prometheus using different configutations to try and get the best performance. This is the reason for there being two options available .  However, in the end I opted not to use either option and instead deployed prometheus using the `prometheus-operator`.
